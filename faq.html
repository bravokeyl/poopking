                    <h3>Who's that cute beagle at the top of the page?</h3>

                    <p>Why that's Lucy. She's a full-time stay-at-home pup. Her passions are snuggling, looking adorable and playing with her sister, Bella. Her skills include: working out on the treadmill, planking, staying still in any position you put her in and balancing treats on her nose. Did I mention she LOVES treats?</p>

                    <h3>Do you charge more for the first visit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nope! We're happy to scoop the extra poo at no additional as a thank you for trying us out. We also use this visit to meet you and your pooch.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Why would I hire a poop scooper to scoop my dog's poo?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because poo is gross! But really, dog waste can generate disease-causing bacteria that can make people sick. For instance, E Coli, a bacterium that can cause disease and fecal coliform bacteria. Dog feces will release excessive amounts of nitrogen into the soil as it breaks down, which results in brown patches or completely burn up parts of the lawn. But mainly, so that you and your family can enjoy a poop free yard!
                    </p>

                    <h3>What if I need a clean up on a specific day due to a special event like a birthday party or family gathering?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We can make a one time trip for an additional $10 or change your service day for that week.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Can I pause the service when my dog is on vacation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely. Work had, play hard. We won't penalize your dog for a little time off.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Is there a contract? </h3>
                    <p>
                        Never! We're that confident that you'll be happy but if not, feel free to cancel anytime.
                    </p>
